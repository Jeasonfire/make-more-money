# Make More Money!

## General
Make More Money! is a game about investing\* and becoming rich. Invest in X corporation, jump off the Y bandwagon before it crashes, keep an eye on the Z stock! You'll also have the option to keep an eye on your reputation. Investing in a human trafficking company is not hip with the kids, who knew!

\* Note: I don't actually know anything about stocks or markets or money, this is just my guess about how a market could work. No realistic market simulation to be found here!
